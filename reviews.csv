Short one liner review about your work culture / office culture.
Good Work life balance 
Work life has stress and less appreciation. Upskilling is required
"Workload is too much which is expected if you work in a Start-up but we do it as a team,.. so efforts are divided proportionately.:) "
Its like more family than a corporate team.

Good but can be better!
Good place to be there and express yourself 
"No in time no out time, we can work from anywhere."
Good but not great

Okay but needs improvement 
Very employee centric
